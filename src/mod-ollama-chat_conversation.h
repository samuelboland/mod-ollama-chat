// Conversation mode.
//
// A person who speaks to a bot face to face holds its attention. Until now a
// bot answered and walked on with whatever it was doing: it could be twenty
// yards off by the time its reply landed, and the person's next line went to
// whichever bot happened to roll for it. The governor's conversation window
// only raised a reply chance.
//
// While a bot is engaged with someone:
//   - it stops, turns to them and holds still (its AI is paused and its
//     movement cleared), when OllamaChat.Conversation.HoldStill is on;
//   - their say and yell lines go to it and only it, unless they name
//     another bot;
//   - their lines count as direct address, so pacing does not swallow them.
//
// It lets go when they have said nothing for HoldSeconds, walk out of
// MaxDistance, change map, log out or die -- and at once when the bot is drawn
// into a fight, so nothing here ever leaves a bot standing still under attack.
// A bot in the person's own group is never held: it follows them anyway, and
// freezing a companion would stop it keeping up.
//
// World thread only, all of it: this reads Players and pauses PlayerbotAI.
