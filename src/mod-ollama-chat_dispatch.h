//
// THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE:
//   worker threads do HTTP and string work only.
//   every read or write of a Player, Channel, Guild, Group or Map happens on
//   the world thread.
//
// Previously each candidate bot spawned its own detached std::thread which
// then called ObjectAccessor, Channel::Say, botAI->Say and re-entered the
// whole eligibility scan -- all racing Map::Update, and all unbounded.
//
// Now: the caller builds the prompt on the world thread and submits. A fixed
// pool of workers performs the generation. Completions come back through a
// queue that OllamaDispatch_Update() drains on the world thread, which is the
// only place delivery happens.
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Resolve the zone-scoped instance of a numbered channel (General, Trade, ...)
// for this bot.
//
// ChannelMgr keys channels by their FULL name, and zone channels are named
// "General - Elwynn Forest", not "General" -- so GetChannel("General") always
// returns nullptr. Matching is by channel id plus zone-name containment, the
// same way PlayerbotAI::SayToChannel does it.
//
// World thread only.
