// One pass over the online player list, reused for the whole of a message or
// a chatter tick.
//
// The module repeatedly asked the same three questions -- "is a real player
// near this bot", "does this bot's guild have a real player online", "is a
// real player in this bot's zone and faction" -- and each one walked
// ObjectAccessor::GetPlayers() from scratch. Asked once per candidate bot,
// inside a loop that was itself over every online player, that is quadratic in
// online characters on every single chat message.
//
// Build one of these once, then answer all three in O(real players), which on
// a bot-heavy realm is a very small number.
//
// WORLD THREAD ONLY, and do not hold one across ticks: the Player pointers are
// only guaranteed valid for the tick that built it.
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Authoritative "is this a bot" test.
//
// PlayerbotsMgr::GetPlayerbotAI() only answers correctly once the AI has been
// attached, and for a freshly logged-in bot that happens inside mod-playerbots'
// own PLAYERHOOK_ON_LOGIN handler. Script hook order between modules is not
// defined, so during login a bot can read as a real player.
//
// That is not theoretical: it is why an all-bot realm generated guild login
// chatter for an audience of nobody. The bot's own login satisfied the
// "is a real player online in this guild" gate, the module spent an LLM round
// trip on a reply, and by the time it was delivered the AI had attached and
// the same check correctly said there was no one to talk to.
//
// WorldSession::_isBot is set in the session constructor, so it is correct from
// the first moment the Player exists. mod-playerbots' own login hook uses it
// for exactly this reason. The AI lookup is kept as a fallback so a bot driven
// by some other mechanism still reads as a bot.
